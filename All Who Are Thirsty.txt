[verse]
All who are th[E]irsty, all who are [G#m7]  weak
Come to the f[A2]ountain
Dip your heart in the [F#m7]stream [E/G#]of [A2]life
Let the [Bsus]pain and the s[E]orrow
Be washed a[G#m]way
In the waves of His m[A2]ercy
As deep cries [F#m7]out [E/G#]to [A2]deep ([Bsus]we sing)

[chorus 1]
[E]Come Lord Jesus [A2]come
[E]Come Lord Jesus [A2]come
[E]Come Lord Jesus [A2]come

[chorus 2]
[E]Holy Spirit [A2]come
[E]Holy Spirit [A2]come
[E]Holy Spirit [A2]come

[bridge]
As deep cries [F#m7]out [E/G#]to [A2]deep
As deep cries [F#m7]out [E/G#]to [A2]deep [Bsus]
