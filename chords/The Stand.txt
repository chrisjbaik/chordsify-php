[verse 1]
[A]You stood before creation
E[D]ternity in Your hand
[A/C#]You spoke the earth into mo[F#m]tion
My soul [D]now to stand

[verse 2]
[A]You stood before my failure
And [D]carried the cross for my shame
My [A/C#]sin weighed upon Your sho[F#m]ulders
My soul n[D]ow to stand

[chorus]
So what can I sa[D]y? [Bm]and what could I d[F#m]o?
But offer this he[D]art oh God[E] completely[F#m] to You

[verse 3]
So [A]I'll walk upon salvation
Your [D]Spirit alive in me
This [A/C#]life to declare Your pr[F#m]omise
My soul n[D]ow to stand

[bridge]
[D]So I'll [A]stand with [E]arms high and [F#m]heart abandoned[D]
In [A]awe of the [E]One who [F#m]gave it all[D]
I'll [A]stand, my [E]soul Lord to [F#m]You surrendered
[D]All I a[A]m is Y[E]ours
