[verse 1]
[D]When the music fa[A/C#]des, all is stripped a[Em]way
And I simply c[Asus]ome [A7]
[D]Longing just to br[A/C#]ing something that's of w[Em]orth 
That will bless Your h[Asus]eart [A7]

[prechorus]
[Em]I'll bring You [D/F#]more than a [Asus]song
For a [A7]song in itself [Em]is not what [D/F#]You have re[Asus]quired [A7]
[Em]You search much [D/F#]deeper with[Asus]in
Through the [A7]way things appear 
[Em]You're looking [D/F#]into my [Asus]heart [A7]

[chorus]
[D]I'm coming back to the [A/C#]heart of worship
And it's [Em]all about [D/F#]You, it's [G]all about [A]You, Jesus
[D]I'm sorry Lord for the [A/C#]thing I've made it 
When it's [Em]all about [D/F#m]You, it's [G]all about [A]You, Je[D]sus

[verse 2]
King of endless worth, no one could express
How much You deserve
Though I'm weak and poor, all I have is Yours
Every single breath
