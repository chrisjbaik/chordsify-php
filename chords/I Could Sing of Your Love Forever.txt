[verse]
[E]Over the mountains and the sea
[F#m7]Your river runs with love for me
[A]And I will open up my [Bsus]heart
And let the healer set me free

[E]I'm happy to be in the truth
[F#m7]And I will daily lift my hands
[A]For I will always sing of
[Bsus]When Your love came down

[chorus]
[E]I could sing of Your [F#m7]love forever
[A]I could sing of Your [Bsus]love forever
[E]I could sing of Your [F#m7]love forever
[A]I could sing of Your [Bsus]love forever

[bridge]
[F#m7]Oh I feel like [E/G#]dancing, [A]it's foolishness [Bsus]I know
[F#m7]But when the world has [E/G#]seen the light
They will [A]dance with joy like we're [Bsus]dancing now
