Sing like [C]never be[Em]fore
[C]O [D]my [Em]soul
I'll [C]worship Your [D]holy name  [C]   [G]   [C]  [G]

[verse1]
The [C]sun comes [G]up, it's a [D]new day [Em]dawning
[C]It's time to [G]sing Your [D]song [Em]again
[C]Whatever may [G]pass, and what[D]ever lies bef[Em]ore me
[C]Let me be [G]singing when the [D]evening [G]comes

[verse2]
You're [C]rich in [G]love, and You're [D]slow to [Em]anger
Your [C]name is [G]great, and Your [D]heart is [Em]kind
For [C]all Your [G]goodness I will [D]keep on [Em]singing
[C]Ten thousand [G]reasons for my [D]heart to [G]find

[verse3]
And [C]on that [G]day when my [D]strength is failing
The [C]end draws [G]near and my [D]time has come
[C]Still my [G]soul will sing Your [D]praise un[Em]ending
[C]Ten thousand [G]years and then fore[D]verm[G]ore
