[verse 1]
[E]What can wash a[C#m]way my sin, [A]nothing but the blood of [B]Je[E]sus
[E]What can make me [C#m]whole again, [A]nothing but the blood of [B]Je[E]sus

[chorus]
[A]Oh, precious [E/G#]is the flow, [F#m]that makes me [A]white as [B]snow
[A]No other [E/G#]fount I know, [F#m]nothing but the blood of [B]Je[E]sus

[verse 2]
For my pardon, this I see, nothing but the blood of Jesus
For my cleansing this my plea, nothing but the blood of Jesus

[verse 3]
Nothing can for sin atone, nothing but the blood of Jesus
Naught of good that I have done, nothing but the blood of Jesus

[verse 4]
This is all my hope and peace, nothing but the blood of Jesus
This is all my righteousness, nothing but the blood of Jesus
