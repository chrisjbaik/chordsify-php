[verse 1]
The sp[A]lendor of the King
[F#m]Clothed in majesty
Let all the earth rej[D]oice
All the earth rejoice

He wraps Himself in light
And darkness tries to hide
And trembles at His voice
Trembles at His voice

[chorus]
How gr[A]eat is our God sing with me
How gr[F#m]eat is our God and all will see
How gr[D]eat how gr[E]eat is our G[A]od

[verse 2]
And age to age He stands
And time is in His hands
Beginning and the end
Beginning and the end

The Godhead three in one
Father, Spirit, Son
The Lion and the Lamb
The Lion and the Lamb

[bridge]
[A]Name above all names
[F#m]Worthy of all praise
My [D]heart will sing
How gr[E]eat is our G[A]od
