[verse 1]
[Bm]This dry and desert land, [G] I tell myself keep walking [D]on
[Bm]Hear something up ahead, [G] water falling like a [D]song
[Bm]An everlasting stream, [G] Your river carries me [D]home
Let it flow, [A] let if flow

[verse 2]
A flood for my soul, a well that never will run dry
I've rambled on my own, never believing I would find
An everlasting stream, Your river carries me home
Let it flow, let it flow

[chorus]
[D]Open the heavens, come Living Water
All my [G]fountains are in Yo[D]u
You're [D]strong like a river, your love is running through
All my [G]fountains are in Yo[D]u

[bridge]
Come on, and [Bm]rain down on us
R[G]ain down on us, L[D]ord
